         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What this Dove propoſeth and preſſeth, is no other, then that the determination of the great differences depending between his Majeſtie and the Parliament, might be referred to the Lords judgement by divine Lott, being an holy way originally inſtituted by God himſelfe to that peculiar end of ending Controverſies, as by <hi>Prov. 18.18.</hi> and many preſidents in holy writ, and the authority of Divines both ancient and moderns is plentifully proved. Neither is there any other way revealed in Gods word, whereby ſo apparent, and immediate a judgement may be ſaid to be given by God, as by this way of the divine Lott; And howſoever, by reaſon of the ignorance of ſome who know not, and therefore neither conceive, nor conſider the holineſſe and happineſſe of this divine way; The infidelity of others, who either doubting of the truth of Gods word, (or perhaps diſtruſting the juſtice of their owne cauſe) dare not truſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the diſpoſition of the Lott; The arrogance and ſelfe conceited obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of others who preferre their owne wiſdomes, counſells or wayes, before the judgement, Oracle, and ordinance of God: And becauſe of the ſelfe-ſeeking ends of others, who principally proſecuting thoſe deſignes which conduce to their owne private purpoſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and preferments, and ſo grow careleſſe of promoting Gods glory, and the Kingdomes peace, but rather protract it) Although I ſay, by reaſon of theſe Remoraes, this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance, Judgement, and Decree of God, may want its due reſpect among the worldly wiſe (as the beſt and moſt divine matters and ordinances, which concerns Gods glory, and the peoples good, uſually meet with ſtrangeſt oppoſition) (the Devill and his agents labouring the prevention of all proceedings tending to that purpoſe) yet the harmleſſe Dove humbly deſires, that all true lovers of Gods glory, the Kings honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſhall therefore proceed to the next point conſiderable concerning Lotts, which

Therefore <hi>nomen</hi> (a name is ſo called) <hi>quaſi nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, quod notitiam facit,</hi> becauſe it affords a more perfect notice, and a more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge of the nature of the thing named. Whence <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a true method of teaching, the names ought firſt to be ſought out, ſifted and ſearched into, <hi>Quia rerum notitia â nominibus dependet,</hi> the knowledge of things doth much depend upon the derivation and Etimologie of their names.</p>
            <p>Now the Etimology of the word <hi>Lot</hi> in ſeverall Languages, I find very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and proper to the end for which Lots were firſt ordained, the ending of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and ſetling of Peace.</p>
            <p>The word Lot (as <hi>Martinius</hi> obſerves) is a Saxon word, and hath its derivation, <hi>A lite quam terminat,</hi> from ſtrife which it determineth. In the German tongue, Lot is called <hi>los</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>litis,</hi> from ſolving of doubts and difficulties, and ſalving of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſſentions; for which end it was primarily and principally ordained, as herein afterwards I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate. Likewiſe the word Lot (as 'tis the proper name of a man) is rendred to ſignifie, <hi>involutas colligatus,</hi> involved, rolled up, wrapped up, either becauſe the inſtrumentall notes or ſignes, the Lots (as they are termed) by which Lottery is uſed, are uſually folded and rolled up, until they are drawn, or elſe becauſe upon the unfolding and opening thereof in extricable difficulties and knots are diſſolved, ſecret and hidden things and myſteries are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyled and revealed, and contentions to humane apprehenſions irreconcileable are compoſed.</p>
            <p>The Latin word <hi>ſors,</hi> ſignifying a Lot, as <hi>Martinius Aretius,</hi> and others affirm, is derived from <hi>ſeries,</hi> which ſignifies a methodicall courſe order, and rule, not <hi>per antephraſin,</hi> (as ſome malevolent ignorants would ſurmize) as meerly caſuall and being voyd of order; but becauſe in doubts indiſſoluble, Chaos-like confuſion, and ambiguous matters; The Lot reduceth ſuch diſtractions and diviſions to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine divine order and rule; When the Apoſtles doubted who ſhould ſucceed in the place of the Apoſtate <hi>Judas,</hi> the Lot immediatly decided that doubt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.

               <p>Thus the Lord God hath directed me, that after the Celebration of the third ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne day of faſting and prayer in ſome ſpacious Church, or place which the Lord ſhall chooſe, <hi>Dout.</hi> 17.8, 9. appointed for that purpoſe, on the Communion table there be ſet, three Chalices, and the Lotts; one for his Majeſtie, another for the Parliament be provided for every particular difference.</p>
               <p>As 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nathanael</hi> the Scribe of the Levites, wrote the Lotts before the King and the Princes, and the high Prieſt, and the chiefe Fathers of the Prieſts and the Levites; So that one particular perſon be appointed, or more, for making any writing the ſeverall Lotts in the preſence of King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Clergy, or other indifferent men on both ſides, who are to ſee to the equall compoſing of them, that no outward diſtinction may be diſcerned by the

               <p>That only two Lotts at one time (or three Lotts, as in ſome caſes occaſion may require) which concern the ſame point in difference, be caſt into the middle Chalice on the Table; and then the Lott which is drawn, and taken to be put into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice which ſtandeth at the upper end of the Table, and the Lott which is left behind in the middle Chalice, to be put into the Chalice at the lower end of the Table. That the particular Lotts be put into the middle Chalice ſucceſſively two or three at a time, and thence drawn, one for each party, by one of the two perſons appointed for that purpoſe, untill the Lotts be all drawn.</p>
               <p>Then the Lotts in the upper Cup to be opened; whereby it may appeare what Lotts are by God given to the King, and what to the Parliament; thus there will be no feare or danger of the deceit either of Compoſers or drawers.</p>

               <p>Having ſhewed (though with much weakneſſe) how divine Lotts may be uſed and applyed for compoſing the preſent Controverſies depending in Church &amp; State, between his Majeſty, and his Parliament, and the form of making and drawing the Lotts, as the Lord was pleaſed to put into my mind (a more pertinent, compleat, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117579:23"/>perfect manner and way then which, no doubt the wiſe and learned may find out.) It reſteth now that ſomewhat be ſaid touching the lawfulneſſe, holineſſe, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of this way of determing differences, and of the Sacred neceſſity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the uſe thereof, in caſes of greateſt difficulty Civill or Sacred, rather then the Sword, or any other humane way or meanes, not onely here, but alſo throughout Chriſtendome, and all parts of the world, where God Almighty is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the great and juſt Judge in Heaven and Earth, and how the holy uſe thereof may be an happy fulfilling of divers Prophecies in the book of God contained.</p>
               <p>The lawfulneſſe of this Sacred Ordinance, I hope and believe no religious or learned man, no good and true Chriſtian will preſume to oppoſe or deny, eſpecially in caſes of ſuch difficulty, as by legall meanes cannot otherwiſe be happily, juſtly, and clearly decided and determined.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard it is an holy Ordinance originally inſtituted by God himſelfe for ending of differences: And alſo an holy Oracle ordained for the diſcovery of hidden matters by humane indeavours inſcrutable and uninveſtigable, as in the firſt chapter of this diſcourſe is plentifully proved and confirmed by divine authority ancient and moderne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe not onely the holy word of God doth likewiſe confirme the lawfulneſſe of the uſe thereof by Gods ſpeciall direction, and the practiſe of the Patriarkes, Prophets, and Apoſtles, but alſo the opinion of the beſt Divines, both ancient and moderne, and the frequent and happy uſe thereof upon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in former, later, and even in theſe times doe manifeſtly atteſt the ſame;<note place="margin">The Apoſtles uſe thereof cleares that. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.16.

The heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſſe, for God is judge himſelf.</note> as in the ſecond chapter appeareth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is no Typicall thing or Ceremony of the old Leviticall law, which by the comming of Chriſt vaniſhed, or was to be abrogated or aboliſhed, but is ſet downe, and prefixed in the firmament of Gods word, as moſt happy and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in a Maxime, Axiome, ſtatute, and Rule of morall, and ſo perpetuall divinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Proverbs of <hi>Salomon,</hi> which are no leſſe Canonicall then any other part of holy Writ, being all holy Canons of ſound morall divinity, as Maſter <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> a religious and learned Expoſitor of that Booke, in his Preface thereunto affirmeth, and if any ſhall object and ſay 'tis there expreſt as a preſcription, not a precept, and ſo may be a matter of meere indifferency, for to be uſed or not uſed; I conceive (under favour of the learned) that all divine directions in Gods word may be ſaid to amount not onely to inſtructions, but even to Injunctions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the direction is given for uſe of any of Gods Ordinances, and the ends of the uſe and practiſe thereof tends immediatly to the advancement of Gods glory, and the good and happineſſe of his Church and people. As herein it muſt needs follow, by making God the Judge and Peace-maker betweene his people; which divine direction if they ſhall refuſe to make uſe of, amounteth to at leaſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this counſells, if not a Rebellion againſt his command, as it muſt be, if Gods preſcriptions ought to be received as precepts.

By this meanes the barbarous way of warre the heavieſt of Gods judgements more fit for heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh brutiſh people then Chriſtians would be avoided, effuſion of bloud prevented, and the glory given to the Lord alone, to whom it is onely and juſtly due, and <hi>for which end God made man,</hi> and ſo the name of God being <hi>ſpread ever the face of the earth.</hi> All Nations might be taught it, and brought to the uſe of this bleſſed way of Reconciliation. To difpiſe or neglect this way of the Lord, and goe the way of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and violence, the way of the Sword, is to change the Judgements of the Lord into wickedneſſe, and to refuſe and contemne the Judgements and Statutes of the Lord, as the Lord by his Prophet complaines, <hi>Ezek</hi> 5.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Surely the way of <hi>Cain</hi> like cruelty, Bloudy butchering of our Brethren, can be no way acceptable, but rather deteſtable to the God of Peace, no ſatisfactory way of Judgement to the conſciences of men, no ſound foundation whereon to ſettle Reformation, or build the Church of Chriſt. The judgement of Chriſt in this way of divine Lott, will appeare more conſonant to the Word, and will of God, more Pious and proſperous among men.

And he ſhall judge among the Nations, and they ſhall beat their ſwords into mattocks, and their ſpeares into pruning-hookes, and ſhall fight no more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vid.</hi> Jer. 3.17, 18. <hi>They ſhall follow no more the hardneſſe of their heart, the houſe of Judah ſhall walke with the houſe of Iſrael, and they ſhall come together out of the land of the north</hi> &amp;c. Now what judgement is intended by theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and whether this divine way of Gods judging in caſes of difference may not be received within the compaſſe of theſe Prophecies, I would be glad to learne? Seeing there is not (that I can find) in the whole booke of God any other imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate way of divine judgement, whereby differences may be decided, particularly provided and ordained by God himſelf to that end, but onely this ſacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: In holy Writ I find but two divine Oracles or ſacred wayes of conſulting with Almighty God in caſes of extreme difficultie, whereby a certaine plaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and immediate reſponſe and reſolution might be received <hi>(videlicet) Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the Lott. The former was a more myſticall and obſcure way; this not unlike that way before mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8, 9. for by Lott a plaine, certaine, and imediate reſolution was alwaies returned, prompt and facile to any ordinary capacity: That way of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is aboliſhed, but this ſacred way of the Lott (no leſſe Antient and holy then the former) as a moſt uſefull, holy, and happy way of Gods divine judgement, ordained for determining of doubtfull, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and dangerous differences is ſtill retained, as by theſe pacificall Proverbs, of the 16.33. and the 18.18. appeares, being both Canonicall and Morall Scripture, and ſo perpetuall divinity; beſides many preſidents, both Ancient and moderne, of the uſe thereof before herein premiſed. And truly, I beleeve this may be juſtly ſaid of this ſacred Ordinance, that it was never piouſly uſed and performed, nay, when by irreligious Infidels practiſed, but it ever brought glory to God, and good to the uſers thereof; that all men may ſee and confeſſe, that the Lord is holy in all his wayes, and juſt in all his judgements.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe this holy way is of eſpeciall happy uſe, for reſolving of doubtfull caſes, diſcovering of hidden and recondite matters, and determining of difficult and mighty differences among mighty perſons; For where Controverſies by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane endevours cannot be decided and the parties on both ſides ſo ſtout, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cannot be appeaſed, by this meanes the matters may be compoſed, and the men pacified.</p>
               <p>In caſes of this nature, thoſe that have the beſt cauſes, and the cleareſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will deſire to have their differences thus decided. For he that is confident of the juſtice of his Cauſe, needs not doubt the judgement of God: and the way of

                  <p>Firſt becauſe 'tis a moſt holy way in three reſpects. 1. In regard of the Author or firſt inſtituter thereof. 2. In reſpect of the ends for which it was ordained. 3. In reſpect of the meanes to attaine thoſe ends, Gods divine way of judgement.</p>
                  <p>The Author and Inſtituter is God himſelfe, as hath been plentifully proved in the precedent part of this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>The ends three. 1. Gods glory, which ſhould they come in competition, wee ought to preferre before the ſalvation of our ſoules.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, in regard 'tis ſatisfactory to the mindes and conſciences of all good men, who will believe and honour the Judgement, in reſpect of the Judges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, who cannot erre or doe wrong.</p>

                  <p>Seventhly, becauſe the further effuſion of blood will hereby be prevented, all parties better contented and all future malice feuds, and diſcontents among many Families and perſons in the Kingdomes forgiven, if not forgotten, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved if not obliterated, which when they ſhall diſcerne the the divine hand and judgement of God in determination of the differences, will remaine more cleerely ſatisfied touching the ſame and one towards another.</p>

Whereas if either party ſhould relinquiſh their former Tenents and condiſcend to any Propoſitions which they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (before the unhappy warre commenced) refuſed to aſſent unto, it might be held and accounted as an argument either of much weakneſſe or wickedneſſe in them, in not yeilding thereunto before ſo much Chriſtian bloud was ſpilt and ſo much miſery calamity diſtraction, and damage had been brought to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by their ſtanding out.</p>

                  <p>Ninthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in caſe of differences in Religion, this divine way without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will prove the moſt pious, proſperous, and moſt pleaſing to God and men, if we conſider theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the glory of God is primarily and imediatly concerned, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered herein <hi>viz.</hi> the ſalvation of his ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hath ſpecial relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and dependeth much upon the doctrine and diſcipline of that Church whereof he is a member.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the chiefe and continuall care of every man ought to be, firſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God, and ſecondly the ſalvation of his ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Now if differences ariſe touching the way which is the moſt pious and beſt way to glorifie God, and attain the ſalvation of ſoules, which is the pureſt way of divine worſhip, which Church hath the moſt orthodox doctrine &amp; diſcipline, whether ſhall the doubting conſcience go for ſatisfaction in thoſe points? It will be anſwered to the Scriptures which are Gods Teſtaments, his revealed will, the Touchſtone of Truth. Thither we are to appeale for ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But then put caſe (as in truth it is) that diverſity of Interpretations have bred diverſity of opinions and diviſions, and ſo controverſies increaſe, and grow end eſſe; Mens corrupt conſtructions have troubled the Fountaine of living waters, with the mud of their miſ-interpretations, the Word of truth, which would give light to the whole world, like the Sunne in his brightneſſe, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſtandard of true doctrine, and determiner of all Controverſies, is hid under the buſhell of mens myſtie-clouded underſtanding and apprehenſion and that which ſhould be a cure for our contentions, is by mans miſpriſion made an occaſion of further difference and determination of the differences of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Surely he that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word that was with God, and that Word which was and is God, will be the fitteſt Judge of the Interpretation of the Word of truth: That Word by which all things were made, and without it was nothing made, muſt make peace betweene the Interpreters of the Word, or it will never be made.

                  <p>Divine providence having made it my Lott (who am leſſer then the leaſt of the ſervants of Chriſt) to treat of the ſacred Ordinance of divine Lott; Let not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and reverend Clergy diſdaine, if ſom texts of holy truth be directed to them from the mouth of the Almighty touching this point of glorifying God, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people his lawes and ſtatures, and ordinances. <hi>And now, ô ye Priests this commandement is for you. If yee will not heare it, nor conſider it in your heart, to give glory unto my Name, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts, I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and will curſe your bleſſings: yea I have curſed them already, becauſe ye doe not conſider it in your heart, Behold I will corrupt your ſeed, and caſt dung upon your faces,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>And ye ſhall know that I have ſent this commandement unto you, that my Covenant with Levi might ſtand. My Covenant was with him of life and peace;</hi> Not warre and deſtruction, not a covenant with death, and agreement with hell. <hi>The law of truth was in his mouth, and he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turne many from iniquity.</hi> He taught Gods people to know the wayes, and walke in the paths of Peace, turned their hearts from inclining to ſtrife and debate, their heads from imagining miſchiefe againſt their brethren, held their hands from ſmiting with the fiſt of wickedneſſe, or being defiled with blood, ſtopt their feet from running the race of Ruine, ſhedding innocent bloud. For the Prieſts lips ſhould pleſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the people ſhould ſeeke the law at his mouth; For ye are the meſſengers of the Lord to that purpoſe; <hi>But yee are gone out of the way: ye have cauſed many to fall by the Law: ye have broken the covenant of Levi of life and peace, ſaith the Lord, Therefore have J alſo made you deſpiſed, and vile before the people; becauſe yee kept not my wayes, but have been partiall in the law. Have wee not all one Father? Hath not one God made us? why doe we tranſgreſſe every one againſt his brother, and breake the covenant of our Fathers? yee have wearied the Lord with your words, when ye ſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where is the God of judgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As God, is the God, not of confuſion, but of peace, ſo he meant and ſent his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be Embaſſadours of peace, not contention. And if God in his Law, his Word, have inſtituted and preſcribed a way, an ordinance of Peace, where ſhall the people ſeeke the knowledge of this Law, this Ordinance, this Statute, but at the mouths of his Miniſters. Is it lawfull for them to goe out of this way, to cauſe the people to fall from this Law? to be partiall touching the Law, to teach what part thereof they like, and neglect what part they diſlike; Doe ye not weary the Lord with your words and wayes, when ye deny or doubt of the way of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine judgement. If a tender Father ſhall offer his judgement to be Umpire, Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, judge, between diſſenting Brethren his children; who refuſe ſuch a Fatherly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and fall by the Sword, and ſo fall to the Sword; ought not the Prieſt to tell thoſe contentious brethren of their Rebellious diſobedience, and ſhew and direct then the divine way of reconciliation? <hi>Jf J be a Father, where is mine honour? if a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117579:30"/>maſter, where is my feare, ſaith the Lord unto you, O prieſts, that deſpiſe my name, and if ye aske wherein? in that ye ſay the way and ordinance of the Lord is not to bee regarded and ye offer blind and lame, and uncleane ſacrifice, humane deviſer, in ſtead of divine directions.</hi> And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 29.30. Marke the Lords expoſtulation with <hi>Eli, Wherfore have ye kicked againſt my ſacrifice and mine offering which I commanded in my Tabernacle, and honoureſt thy children above me, to make your ſelves fat of the first fruits of the offering of my people? But it ſhall not be ſo: for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be deſpiſed. Behold, the dayes that I will cut off thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers, &amp;c.</hi> May not the Lord ſay the like to the deſpiſers of his Ordinance? wherefore have you preferred the iſſues of your owne braines, before my Inſtituted Ordinance, to make your ſelves rich and glorious thereby? I will cut off your power and authority, <hi>&amp;c. Remember the law of Moſes my ſervant, with the ſtatutes. Judgements and ordinances wich I commanded, &amp;c.</hi> The Prince, Parliament, Prophet, Prieſt and People may pleaſe to obſerve and remember thoſe texts touching the Lords glory, and his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this point with that of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah: Heare ye, and give care, be not proud, for the Lord hath ſpoken it. Give glory to the Lord your God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bring darkneſſe, and before your feet ſtumble in the darke mountaines, and while yee looke for light, he turne it into the ſtadow of death, and make it as darkneſſe. But if yee will not heare this, my ſoule ſhall weep in ſecret for your pride,</hi> vide Pſal. 10.4.5. <hi>The wicked is ſo proud, he ſeeketh not for God, but worldly goods. Gods judgements are high above his ſight, &amp;c.</hi>
